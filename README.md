Work Day Scheduler

## Description


I have been tasked with creating work day calendar application that allows a iser to save events for each hour of the day by modifying the starte code. 

The app should:

* Display the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner.
* Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
* Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.
* Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock
* Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.
* Persist events between refreshes of a page



## Technologies Used
This project was created using 
*JavaScript
*HTML
*CSS


## Screenshot
Once deployed you can see the web application in your browser. It should look like the screen shot attached
